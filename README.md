# Python for Digital Connector

A python library to work with digital connector through python. 

## Current Scope
The library currently only supports building recipe's through python. Please look through Samples in order to see how it is done.   
We would build more detailed tutorials in the near future as the repository is under development.

## What to expect in near Future?
- Capability to build importers in Python
- Detailed tutorials
- Contribution Guide

### Note this repository is still under development, code may not work properly.
