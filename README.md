# Python Support for Digital Connector

A python script to work with digital connector through python. 

## Current Scope
The library currently only supports building recipe through python. Please look through Samples in order to see how it is done.   
We would build more detailed tutorials in the near future as the repository is under development.

*Note: At the moment we don't provide support for contributions and pull requests.*

## What to expect in near Future?
- Capability to build importers in Python
- Detailed tutorials
- Contribution Guide

### Note: this repository is still under development, there maybe bugs.
