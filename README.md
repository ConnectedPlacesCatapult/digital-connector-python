# Python Support for Digital Connector

A python script to work with digital connector through python. 

## Current Scope
The library currently only supports building recipe(Windows, Mac and Linux) and importers(Mac and Linux) through python. Please look through Samples and Importers folder in order to see how it is done.   
We would build more detailed tutorials in the near future as the repository is under development.

*Note: At the moment we don't provide support for contributions and pull requests.*

## What to expect in near Future?
- Detailed tutorials
- Contribution Guide

## City Data Hackathon
- You can find example recipes for the 3 hackathon challenges in Samples Folder

### Note: this repository is still under development, there maybe bugs.
